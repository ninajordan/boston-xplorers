# Design Document – Project 2 - Boston-Xplores

## Project Description

Boston-Xplorers was designed as a centralized destination guide for newcomers and tourists seeking to explore Boston’s attractions in a streamlined and efficient way. The application provides users with the ability to discover notable locations, build personalized itineraries, and browse curated pre-made itineraries without needing to search across multiple platforms or sift through extensive review content.

Users are able to create, save, and manage their own itineraries, as well as copy and customize existing itineraries to suit their preferences. This functionality supports both independent exploration and guided inspiration.
